# Alien Invasion

### This Project aims to reconstruct the classic game, Alien Invasion, by using the Pygames module.

This project will be using Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes to teach me the basics of Pygames, and will serve as a foundation, from which to build other projects from.

## Design Checklist in Order of Priority:

### Unfortunately, I did not have the time to implement the 1-Up reward, as I am beginning work on learning Django.
- Potentially have 1-UP rewards for score
